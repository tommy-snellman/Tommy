Hello World!
It's great to be here!
Unfortunately I'm not any good at using git! :(

But here's some cmds that's useful to know!

Change what folder you're in: cd <foldername> (to go deeper just but backslashes after each folder -> <foldername>/<foldername>etc...)



When you're in a folder and want to make git track changes in the folder: git init
