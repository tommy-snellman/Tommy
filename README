UBUNTU->Hello World!:D Woopwoop
It's great to be here!
Unfortunately I'm not any good at using git! :(

But here's some cmds that's useful to know!!

Change what folder you're in: cd <foldername> (to go deeper just put forwardslashes after each folder -> <foldername>/<foldername>etc...)

Go back a folder: cd ..

Edit a file with VIM: vim <filename>

Save and exit file in VIM: Cmd-mode(esc): ZZ

Exit without saving in VIM: Cmd-mode: q!

When you're in a folder and want to make git track changes in the folder: git init

Check what's changed and can be commited and pushed: git status

Add a file/folder to commit-stage: git add <file/folder-name> (if folder use <foldername>/ to get all subfolders + files aswell)

Add a file/folder to push-stage + commit message: git commit -m "<message>"

Push the file/folder to the branch (in this case master): git push origin master

Remove a file/folder: if file-> git rm <filename> | if folder-> git rm -rf <foldername>

Rename/Move a file/folder: git mv <oldname> <newname>

List available branches: git branch

Change to a branch: git checkout <branchname>
